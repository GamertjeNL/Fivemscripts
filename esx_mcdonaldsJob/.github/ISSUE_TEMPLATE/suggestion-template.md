Please do NOT remove any text from the template, only add your title and add your answers below, if you have more information by all means add it, but do not remove any details already existing below, this will void your request and we will not respond if it is not filled out correctly.

**Disclaimer**
Due to the fact that people are providing such little information and expecting us to be able to fix their problem, we are now enforcing these issue templates through github, if you fill these forms out incorrectly or provide little information, then expect little help in return, we, as addon creators spend hours/days/weeks and even months and years doing this for FREE, both creating addons and giving support, so please show some courtesy and atleast have a fair go at diagnosing and fixing your problem before creating a post and possibly wasting not only your own time, but the people that are trying to create resources for server owners like you. 

**FAQ - (Frequently Asked Questions)**
Q: Why is nothing showing up but I have the McDonalds Job?
A: This is likely due to the fact that you have spelt the resource incorrectly in your server.cfg meaning the resource has failed to start.

Q: Why do the inside tables have a wind effect?
A: This is due to that fact that RockStar designed these tables to be outside and the the Building Creator decided to use these tables. You are free to modify the YMAP and use tables that suit your liking

Q: Why does rain come inside the building?
A: This happens with a lot of custom built buildings as they are hard to setup collisions with the limited streamable items that FiveM allows, especially for GTA's weather effects an issue you will either have to deal with or struggle for hours trying to fix.

Q: Why does an AI Car keep crashing into the building?
A: Again this is the way GTA is Designed, AI are unable to detect some custom collision boxes and will consistantly try to make their way through the building, my only suggestions are, add a boomgate where the AI drive into the parking lot, hopefully prevently them from entering all together, or disabling AI cars from your server.

Q: Why does the job name say McDonalds: Cook, but im a delivery driver?
A: To be honest this is my first resource so I was unable to figure out how to change your job rank when you select to be a delivery driver persey. This should be fixed in a later update, for now it will have to be done manually (/setjob ID McDonalds 3) when you change your job at McDonalds.
